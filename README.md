#### To our instructors


We knew that most of the people who would eventually join Nudge likely hadnâ€™t even heard of us yet, the handbook was our way of ensuring that information sharing was efficient and easy.

We draw insights from esteemed online platforms and academic institutions, combining them with our own accumulated cases to optimize our work. Just like our other work, we also constantly adjust our values and strive to make them better.

Our work is largely dependent on the contributions of our instructors, and as such, we are committed to building an effective framework to ensure their interests are protected. We greatly welcome feedback from our instructors. We also recognize that we have a global audience and that may bring different interpretations. If you have any questions or need further clarification please contact us.

Remember that everything is in draft at Nudge and subject to change, this includes our handbook.
