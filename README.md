#### To our instructors


We realize that many who choose to join Nudge may not have previously known about us, hence our handbook serves as a streamlined and effective mode for information dissemination.

We gather insights from reputable online platforms and academic institutions, incorporating these with our own compiled cases to enhance our work. As with all our initiatives, we continually refine our services and values, aiming for continuous improvement.

Our endeavors are profoundly reliant on the contributions of instructors, prompting us to develop a robust framework to ensure their interests are protected. Instructor feedback is immensely appreciated. Feedback from instructors is highly valued. We acknowledge that our audience spans across the globe, which can lead to varied interpretations. Should you have any queries or require additional clarification, please reach out to us.

Remember that everything is in draft at Nudge and subject to change, this includes our handbook.
