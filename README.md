#### To our instructors

<div style="background-color: lightgrey; padding: 10px;">

ðŸ§© We realize that many who choose to join Nudge may not have previously known about us. Therefore, our handbook acts as an effective method for disseminating information.


We gather insights from esteemed online platforms and academic institutions, merging these with our own compiled cases to enhance our work. As with all our initiatives, we continually refine our services and values, aiming for continuous improvement.


Our endeavors are profoundly reliant on instructors' contributions, prompting us to develop a robust framework to ensure their interests are protected, so instructor feedback is highly valued. At the same time, we know that our audience spans across the globe, which can lead to varied interpretations. Should you have any queries or require additional clarification, please contact us.


Remember that everything is in draft at Nudge and subject to change. This includes our handbook.
