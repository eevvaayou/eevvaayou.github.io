The following text is intended to serve as a foundation for discussions among instructors, teaching assistants, and other pedagogical support personnel.

<br>
<br>

##### 1.Anti-Bullying and Non-Discrimination
Instructors must adhere to policies and procedures on anti-bullying and non-discrimination.
<br>
##### 2.Professional Conduct and Judgment
Instructors must refrain from actions displaying extreme negligence or poor professional judgment that might endanger the health, safety, or well-being of students or the company, or unreasonably impede an individual's or the company's ability to perform their duties or undertake their educational or training programs.
<br>
##### 3.Confidentiality
It is imperative for instructors to maintain the confidentiality of records and documents related to students and employees, which can reasonably be considered as confidential. This might include employment details, personnel records, or student materials.
<br>
##### 4.Authority
Due to the authoritative stature of instructors in the academic realm, they have the capacity to influence others' thoughts and actions. They also have a responsibility to recognize the potential weight of their verbal and non-verbal expressions. As leaders in the classroom, instructors have not only the responsibility to disseminate invigorating ideas and pose academic challenges but also to maintain courtesy and respect in intellectual dialogues.
<br>
##### 5.Fair Treatment of All Students
Students should be treated equitably. However, treating all students in an identical manner does not necessarily result in fairness. For instance, while some students respond positively to sincere and appropriate criticism, others might find it discouraging. Some students welcome public feedback on their work, while others might find it discomforting. Truly equitable treatment of students hinges on diligently recognizing and appreciating these differences. Both instructors and students should be vigilant against racial, religious, gender-based, and other discriminatory stereotypes.
<br>
##### 6.Clear Communication
Given that a part of students' evaluations depends on their understanding of the course requisites, instructors should clearly articulate their expectations, assignments, and rules for collaboration and citation. Providing written explanations of tasks and requirements can mitigate the risk of misconceptions. Students are entitled to demand clear justifications for the instructor's assessments, just as instructors are entitled to expect timely and sincere completion of assignments by students.
<br>
##### 7.Criticism
Feedback should be directed towards the assignment/work and not the individual; it should facilitate improvement in thought and expression. Arbitrary disdain is inappropriate.
<br>
##### 8.Interactions with Minors
In settings requiring interactions with minors (individuals under the age of 18), instructors should cultivate and maintain an appropriate and safe environment.
<br>
##### 9.Instructorâ€™s specific obligations
a.The Instructor or company must ensure that each course is materially accurate and complete with regard to its subject matter as of the date it is delivered to NUDGE.
b.The Instructor will not post or provide any illegal, inappropriate, offensive, racist, hateful, sexist, pornographic or infringing material.
