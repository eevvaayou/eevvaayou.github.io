The following text is intended to serve as a foundation for discussions among instructors, teaching assistants, and other pedagogical support personnel.

<br>
<br>

##### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">1.Anti-Bullying and Non-Discrimination</span>
Instructors must strictly adhere to established policies and procedures regarding anti-bullying and non-discrimination. This includes actively fostering an inclusive and respectful environment for all students and staff.
<br>
##### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">2.Professional Conduct and Judgment</span>
Instructors must avoid any actions that demonstrate extreme negligence or poor professional judgment. Such behaviors can jeopardize the health, safety, or well-being of students and staff or hinder the individual’s or company’s operational effectiveness and educational or training objectives.
<br>
##### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">3.Confidentiality</span>
Instructors are entrusted with the crucial responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive records and documents. This information includes, but is not limited to, employment details, personnel records, and student materials. Strict adherence to confidentiality protocols is mandatory.
<br>
##### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">4.Authority</span>
Because of the authoritative stature of instructors in the academic realm, they can influence others’ thoughts and actions. They are responsible for recognizing the potential weight of their verbal and non-verbal expressions. As classroom leaders, instructors are responsible for disseminating invigorating ideas, posing academic challenges, and maintaining courtesy and respect in intellectual dialogues.
<br>
##### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">5.Fair Treatment of All Students</span>
Students must treated fairly and impartially. However, achieving equity does not necessarily mean treating all students identically. For example, while some students may thrive on constructive criticism, others may find it demotivating. Similarly, while public feedback on work may encourage some students, it might cause embarrassment for others. Genuine even-handedness in treating students involves consciously acknowledging and respecting these differences. Everyone in a classroom should be particularly vigilant against stereotypes based on ethnicity, religion, gender, or other factors.
<br>
##### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">6.Clear Communication</span>
Clear instructor communication is crucial because students’ evaluations partly hinge on their understanding of course requirements. Instructors should articulate expectations, assignments, and collaboration rules with precision. This information includes providing detailed explanations of assignments and requirements to minimize misunderstandings. Likewise, students deserve a clear rationale for their evaluations, paralleling the instructors’ rightful expectation of assignments being completed thoughtfully and punctually.
<br>

##### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">7.Criticism</span>
Comments should focus on the work rather than individuals. They should aim to enhance both thought processes and presentation. Arbitrary disdain is inappropriate.
<br>

##### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">8.Interactions with Minors</span>
In settings requiring interactions with minors (individuals under the age of 18), instructors should cultivate and maintain an appropriate and safe environment.
<br>

##### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">9.Restrictions</span>
Instructors are strictly prohibited from posting, providing, or engaging in any form of communication that includes illegal, inappropriate, offensive, racist, sexist, hateful, pornographic, or any other infringing material. This point extends to all forms of interaction and communication within and outside the course setting. Violation of these standards may result in termination.
<br>

##### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">10.Teaching Schedule and Responsibilities</span>
Once a teaching schedule is established, instructors are responsible for ensuring consistent and uninterrupted teaching. While short-term absences for unforeseen personal events or career development are understandable, these absences should generally not exceed one week. Instructors must adhere to their designated teaching roles. Any deviations from the original teaching plan should be rare and justified only under extraordinary circumstances.
