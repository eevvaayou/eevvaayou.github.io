The following text is intended to serve as a foundation for discussions among instructors, teaching assistants, and other pedagogical support personnel.

<br>
<br>

##### 1.Anti-Bullying and Non-Discrimination
Instructors must adhere to policies and procedures on anti-bullying and non-discrimination.
<br>
##### 2.Professional Conduct and Judgment
Instructors must refrain from actions displaying extreme negligence or poor professional judgment that might endanger the health, safety, or well-being of students or the company, or unreasonably impede an individual's or the company's ability to perform their duties or undertake their educational or training programs.
<br>
##### 3.Confidentiality
It is imperative for instructors to maintain the confidentiality of records and documents related to students and employees, which can reasonably be considered as confidential. This might include employment details, personnel records, or student materials.
<br>
##### 4.Authority
Due to the authoritative stature of instructors in the academic realm, they have the power to influence others' thoughts and actions. They have a responsibility to recognize the potential weight of their verbal and non-verbal expressions. As leaders in the classroom, instructors have not only the responsibility to disseminate invigorating ideas and pose academic challenges but also to maintain courtesy and respect in intellectual dialogues.
<br>
##### 5.Fair Treatment of All Students
Students should be treated with fairness and impartiality. However, achieving equity does not necessarily mean treating all students in exactly the same way. For instance, while some students may respond positively to constructive criticism, others may find it discouraging. Some students may appreciate public feedback on their work, whereas others might feel embarrassed by it. Genuinely even-handed treatment of students depends upon making a conscientious attempt to recognize and appreciate such differences. Both teachers and students should be particularly vigilant against stereotyping based on ethnicity, religion, gender, or other discriminatory factors.
<br>
##### 6.Clear Communication
Because the evaluation of students partly depends on their understanding of the requirements of a course, instructors should be clear in their articulation of expectations, assignments, and the rules of collaboration. Providing explanations of assignments and requirements reduces the risk of misunderstanding. Students have the right to expect a clear justification of evaluation, just as instructors have the right to expect that assignments will be completed thoughtfully and on time.
<br>

##### 7.Criticism
Comments should focus on the work rather than the individual, aiming to enhance both thought processes and presentation.  Arbitrary disdain is inappropriate.
<br>

##### 8.Interactions with Minors
In settings requiring interactions with minors (individuals under the age of 18), instructors should cultivate and maintain an appropriate and safe environment.
<br>

##### 9.Instructorâ€™s specific obligations
a. Instructors or company must ensure that each course is materially accurate and complete with regard to its subject matter as of the date it is delivered to NUDGE.<br>
b. The Instructor will not post or provide any illegal, inappropriate, offensive, racist, hateful, sexist, pornographic or infringing material.
<br>

##### 10.Instructors' Presence
After establishing their teaching schedule, instructors are expected to maintain continuity in their instruction. However, short absences for unforeseen personal business or professional development during instruction are possible. Generally, absences  should not exceed one week. Instructors are expected to fulfill their assigned teaching obligations, with changes to the original teaching arrangement allowed only in exceptional cases.
