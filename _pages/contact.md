The following text is intended to serve as a foundation for discussions among instructors, teaching assistants, and other pedagogical support personnel.

<br>
<br>

##### 1.Anti-Bullying and Non-Discrimination
Instructors are required to strictly adhere to established policies and procedures regarding anti-bullying and non-discrimination. This includes actively fostering an inclusive and respectful environment for all students and staff.
<br>
##### 2.Professional Conduct and Judgment
Instructors must avoid any actions that demonstrate extreme negligence or poor professional judgment. Such behaviors can jeopardize the health, safety, or well-being of students and staff, or hinder the individual’s or company’s operational effectiveness and educational or training objectives.
<br>
##### 3.Confidentiality
Instructors are entrusted with the crucial responsibility of maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive records and documents. This includes, but is not limited to, employment details, personnel records, and student materials. Strict adherence to confidentiality protocols is mandatory.
<br>
##### 4.Authority
Due to the authoritative stature of instructors in the academic realm, they have the power to influence others' thoughts and actions. They have a responsibility to recognize the potential weight of their verbal and non-verbal expressions. As leaders in the classroom, instructors have not only the responsibility to disseminate invigorating ideas and pose academic challenges but also to maintain courtesy and respect in intellectual dialogues.
<br>
##### 5.Fair Treatment of All Students
Students should be treated fairly and impartially. However, achieving equity does not necessarily mean treating all students identically. For example, while some students may thrive on constructive criticism, others may find it demotivating. Similarly, while public feedback on work may be encouraging for some, it might cause embarrassment for others. Genuine even-handedness in treating students involves a conscious effort to acknowledge and respect these differences. Both teachers and students should be particularly vigilant against stereotypes based on ethnicity, religion, gender, or any other discriminatory factors.
<br>
##### 6.Clear Communication
Clear communication from instructors is crucial as students’ evaluations partly hinge on their understanding of course requirements. Instructors should articulate expectations, assignments, and collaboration rules with precision. This includes providing detailed explanations of assignments and requirements to minimize misunderstandings. Likewise, students deserve a clear rationale for their evaluations, paralleling the instructors’ rightful expectation of assignments being completed thoughtfully and punctually.
<br>

##### 7.Criticism
Comments should focus on the work rather than the individual, aiming to enhance both thought processes and presentation.  Arbitrary disdain is inappropriate.
<br>

##### 8.Interactions with Minors
In settings requiring interactions with minors (individuals under the age of 18), instructors should cultivate and maintain an appropriate and safe environment.
<br>

##### 9.Restrictions
Instructors are strictly prohibited from posting, providing, or engaging in any form of communication that includes illegal, inappropriate, offensive, racist, sexist, hateful, pornographic, or any other infringing material. This extends to all forms of interaction and communication, both within and outside the classroom setting. Violation of these standards may result in termination of employment.
<br>

##### 10.Teaching Schedule and Responsibilities
Teaching Schedule and Responsibilities: Once a teaching schedule is established, instructors are responsible for ensuring a consistent and uninterrupted teaching process. While short-term absences for unforeseen personal events or career development are understandable, these should generally not exceed one week. Instructors are obliged to adhere to their designated teaching roles. Any deviations from the original teaching plan should be rare and justified only under extraordinary circumstances.
