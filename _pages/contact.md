The following text is intended to serve as a foundation for discussions among instructors, teaching assistants, and other pedagogical support personnel.

<br>
<br>

##### 1.Anti-Bullying and Non-Discrimination
Instructors must adhere to policies and procedures on anti-bullying and non-discrimination.
<br>
##### 2.Professional Conduct and Judgment
Instructors must refrain from actions displaying extreme negligence or poor professional judgment that might endanger the health, safety, or well-being of students or the company, or unreasonably impede an individual's or the company's ability to perform their duties or undertake their educational or training programs.
<br>
##### 3.Confidentiality
It is imperative for instructors to maintain the confidentiality of records and documents related to students and employees that are considered confidential. This might include employment details, personnel records, or student materials.
<br>
##### 4.Authority
Due to the authoritative stature of instructors in the academic realm, they have the power to influence others' thoughts and actions. They have a responsibility to recognize the potential weight of their verbal and non-verbal expressions. As leaders in the classroom, instructors have not only the responsibility to disseminate invigorating ideas and pose academic challenges but also to maintain courtesy and respect in intellectual dialogues.
<br>
##### 5.Fair Treatment of All Students
Students should be treated fairly and impartially. However, achieving equity does not necessarily mean treating all students identically. For example, while some students may thrive on constructive criticism, others may find it demotivating. Similarly, while public feedback on work may be encouraging for some, it might cause embarrassment for others. Genuine even-handedness in treating students involves a conscious effort to acknowledge and respect these differences. Both teachers and students should be particularly vigilant against stereotypes based on ethnicity, religion, gender, or any other discriminatory factors.
<br>
##### 6.Clear Communication
Because the evaluation of students partly depends on their understanding of the requirements of a course, instructors should be clear in their articulation of expectations, assignments, and the rules of collaboration. Providing explanations of assignments and requirements reduces the risk of misunderstanding. Students are entitled to a clear justification for their evaluations, just as instructors rightfully expect assignments to be completed thoughtfully and in a timely manner.
<br>

##### 7.Criticism
Comments should focus on the work rather than the individual, aiming to enhance both thought processes and presentation.  Arbitrary disdain is inappropriate.
<br>

##### 8.Interactions with Minors
In settings requiring interactions with minors (individuals under the age of 18), instructors should cultivate and maintain an appropriate and safe environment.
<br>

##### 9.Restrictions
The Instructor shall not post or provide any illegal, inappropriate, offensive, racist, hateful, sexist, pornographic or infringing material.
<br>

##### 10.Teaching Schedule and Responsibilities
Following the establishment of a teaching schedule, instructors must ensure a steady, continuous teaching process. Short-term absences due to unforeseen personal events or career development during the teaching period can be factored in, typically not surpassing one week. Instructors have a duty to perform their assigned teaching roles faithfully, with changes to the original teaching plan permitted only under special and uncommon circumstances.
