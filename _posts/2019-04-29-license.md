#### Problem/Project-Based Learning

Problem/Project-Based Learning (PBL) effectively integrates teaching techniques and course content through carefully crafted real-world problems. These challenges inspire students to embrace problem-solving strategies, engage in self-directed learning, work collaboratively in groups, and apply knowledge relevant to their domain. This approach goes beyond mere knowledge acquisition. It is instrumental in cultivating key soft skills.
