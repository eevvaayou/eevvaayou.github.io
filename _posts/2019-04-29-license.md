#### Problem/Project-Based Learning
Problem-Based Learning (PBL) blends teaching techniques and curricular matters via real-world problems thoughtfully devised. These issues compel students to adopt problem-solving approaches, engage in self-led learning, collaborate in groups, and utilize domain-relevant knowledge. More than just focusing on knowledge acquisition, this strategy is instrumental in cultivating key soft skills.
