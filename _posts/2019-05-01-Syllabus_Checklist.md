We know that a syllabus is that document that you give students in advance of the course so that they can read them before deciding whether to enroll. But a good syllabus can also do more! Make sure that the syllabus would make someone want to enroll in the course!

**The syllabus can act as a contract that will help students know what they should do in order to succeed in the course. It should also let them know what they can expect of you. Design a course syllabus to best meet your teaching style, course content, activities. 
This training will walk you through the basics of what should go in your syllabus.**
