#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">1. Standardized Course</span>

- **Delivery:** Interactive group online course. 

- **Enrollment:** The expected number of students for each course typically ranges from 6 to 15. Students are primarily undergraduates with academic backgrounds in disciplines related to the project or interdisciplinary fields. 

- **Time Commitment:** Each instructor's course is approximately 10-12 hours long, spread over 4-6 consecutive weeks. Instructors should schedule fixed class times weekly within the course period, ensuring two consecutive sessions per week with at least 50 minutes per session. The time dedicated to course planning and evaluating student assignments is excluded from teaching hours.

- **Annual Planning:** The instructors coordinate course schedules with the company based on their available time and workload. If necessary, collaborate with other instructors to conduct the courses. Generally, there are 3-4 rounds per year. 

- **Class Support:** Each course has a dedicated class supervisor for the duration of the course. They ensure that the course is progressing smoothly and facilitate communication between instructors and students, resolving any course-related issues as needed.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:#ffb300;">2. Course Design Framework</span>

The structured design of the course should consider aspects such as learning objectives, content, learning activities, project management for course completion, and completion standards. Below is a basic template for standard course design.

- **Course Goals:** Clearly define the course learning objectives, including goals related to knowledge, skills, abilities, and practical outputs from students. These objectives should be relevant to real-world applications.

- **Content:** Divide the content into different modules or stages. Each module should correspond with the learning objectives. The content should be periodically updated to continuously align with advancements in the academic field. Identify the background knowledge and prerequisites required for the course so that students can successfully complete it. When necessary, we will match students with prerequisite course (If you have suitable cooperating teachers/mentors/instructors/teaching assistants, please don't hesitate to introduce them to us.).

- **Learning Activities:** Learning activities include, but are not limited to, case studies, online discussions, coding tests. These activities should inspire students' learning and research and cultivate problem-solving skills and critical thinking.

- **Final Project Assignment Management:** Determine the time schedule, resource requirements, and team composition (if necessary) for the students' final projects. Clearly outline the management plan for their completion, including progress tracking, problem support, and collaborative task assignments (if necessary).

- **Assessment Criteria:** Specify the standard criteria for the final assessments to ensure fairness and consistency in evaluation. Students must meet the expected requirements to complete the course.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:#ffb300;">3. Homework Management</span>

- **Clear Expectations and Workload:** Instructors should clearly outline the students' weekly homework tasks. Between one and three homework tasks are recommended. instructors should estimate the time required for each assignment to ensure the total workload does not exceed 10 hours per week. To avoid conflicts with students' School learning tasks, if a instructor's weekly homework time is expected to exceed 10 hours,  consider further task delineation or adjustment of homework requirements.

- **Assignment Planning:** Students should be informed in advance of their weekly homework tasks and deadlines to allow for proper time management.

- **Streamlining Management Tools:** Instructors should select homework management software from the list provided by the company that aligns with their course. They must inform company at least one week before the course begins so that we can prepare the course page and invite instructors to join. (Feel free to let us know if you have a homework software that you prefer.) If no homework software is needed, instructors can choose to have students submit homework and provide feedback to students via email. This method requires instructors and students to cc the class supervisor on all communications.

- **Pre-Class Assessment and Feedback:** The instructors should review all student work at least one day before class. Feedback and evaluation of student homework during class should not exceed 15 minutes, not excessively occupying normal class time.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">4. The Final Project</span>

- **Determining Final Project Topics:** By the third week of the course or earlier, the instructors need to assist each student in determining their final project topic/research topic to ensure that students have enough time to prepare and complete it before the end of the course. The estimated work time for the final project assignment should be between 20 and 30 hours. The instructors should keep an eye on the progress students are making with their projects and provide feedback and support.

- **Final Project Formats:** The instructors can design final project assignments as research proposals, modeling and software development, etc.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">5. Course Conclusion</span>

- **Final Project Presentation:** The students are required to present their final projects in the last week of the course. For courses with a large number of registrants, the instructors may limit the number of presenters, such as selecting students who volunteer to present individually or in groups. Students who do not present their final projects will submit their results online to the company and the instructors for final evaluation.

- **Certificate:** Instructors, or Nudge with the instructor's authorization, will assess each student based on the evaluation criteria and issue certificates to each student.

- **Recommendation Letter:** The instructors should write recommendation letters for outstanding students with needs. When writing recommendation letters or evaluations, the instructors should provide specific descriptions of student achievements and abilities. However, the writing of recommendation letters is not mandatory.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">6. Course Materials</span>

- **Material Submission:** Instructors are required to submit all course materials one week before the start of the teaching session to allow the company sufficient time to review and prepare.

- **Resource Variety:** Necessary course materials include slides for all sessions, relevant assignment materials, programming tools list (if necessary), etc. Other course materials may include audiovisual materials, resource links, code, datasets, and any other supportive materials. If necessary, instructors should assist company personnel in checking whether the materials can be accessed and used smoothly by students before the teaching session to ensure smooth access and utilization of course materials.

- **Review and Updates:** Instructors should regularly review course materials to ensure accuracy and completeness and make updates and adjustments as necessary.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">7. Hourly Rate</span>

- The instructors'hourly rates generally remain stable, but to ensure fairness and transparency, rates may vary based on **market demand, instructor's role, and the overall value** of the courses provided.
We will provide instructors with an explanation of how hourly rates are calculated and factors affecting changes in advance and reach a consensus before the course begins.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">8. Video Quality and Access</span>

- **Make sure the video is in high definition.**

- **The audio should be clear and non-disruptive** 

- **Landscape orientation for display** 

- **Join the course via computer.**

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">9. Testing Services</span>

- We recommend contacting us as soon as possible for testing services to obtain personalized support and feedback on your audio and video quality.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">10. Policy Compliance</span>
