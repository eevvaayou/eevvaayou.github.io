[MAPPING UTOPIAS](http://ka-au.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/KAAU_LessonPlan_mappingutopias.pdf)
This workshop is part of the Knowledge Alliance for Advanced Urbanism Project, co-funded by the  Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union.

The Workshop will be focused on using sensors and/or drones to capture data from public space, process the data and create dynamic alternative cartographies of the public space (based on data such as environmental data and flow patterns).
