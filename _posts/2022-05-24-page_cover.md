Nudge ensures course quality through a set of clear standards applicable to all majors. These standards, which are the focus of our evaluation process, primarily concern teaching and learning：

<u>1. Solicitation and appraisal of new courses.</u>

<u>2. Assessment of student learning.</u>

<u>3. Risk-based evaluation of existing courses.</u>

We strive to maintain efficiency in course development to prevent undue burden on our instructors, who are already engaged in extensive research activities. Therefore, it is essential for instructors to be well-versed in the evaluation criteria beforehand.

##### 1.	Solicitation and Appraisal of New Courses 
Nudge’s quality assurance process begins with the solicitation and evaluation of course proposals. Upon reaching a contract agreement, instructors must submit a course outline. After a preliminary evaluation, they start developing the course, making sure to complete the final evaluation before the course begins.

This process aligns the course content with student needs. The primary objective is to address key questions:

<font color="gray">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Will students gain the knowledge deemed essential for academic or professional success?</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>What necessary modifications to the course structure or teaching strategies might be needed? </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Could additional techniques, resources, or materials improve learning effectiveness?  </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Are the slides and learning resources adequate, accessible, and in compliance with educational standards?  </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Is there a mechanism in place to ensure the appropriateness of the established answers and grading schemes?</u><br>
</font>
<br>

Responses to these questions assist instructors in determining appropriate actions and strategies for the continuous improvement of learning experiences. Instructors are required to provide all course files for each course they intend to host at Nudge well in advance of the course start date. This includes, but is not limited to, slides, data sources, literature, and other learning resources. These materials aid the Nudge team in evaluating the quality and completeness of the course offerings.

##### 2. Learning Outcome Evaluation 
The following guidelines outline the general principles for evaluating student learning outcomes. These principles define our approach towards preparing students for success in their chosen subjects. Students are expected to achieve the following learning outcomes through their academic activities during the course cycle:

<font color="gray">
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Demonstrate knowledge and skills in a specific discipline, and apply these competencies ethically in real-life environments.  </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Utilize research skills in academic work.</u><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Locate, evaluate, and effectively use information from various sources (Information Literacy).</u><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Analyze quantitative data and derive reasonable conclusions (Quantitative Reasoning).</u><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Evaluate problems logically from multiple perspectives, and develop reasonable and creative solutions (Critical Thinking).</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, to diverse audiences (Communication).</u><br>

<br>
<br>

##### 3.	Risk-Based Evaluation of Existing Courses 
Nudge regularly collects metrics for each academic program it offers. High-risk programs are identified as those presenting one or more strategic risks such as operational health of courses, relevance to Nudge’s vision, and market demand. Nudge uses the following indicators to identify high-risk programs: 

<font color="gray">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Student enrollment and learning outcomes (including student-teacher ratio, attrition rate etc.). </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Stakeholder satisfaction (including students etc.).</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Changes in the professional background of instructors and available resources.</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>The relevance of the curriculum and effectiveness of course delivery.</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Achievement of learning outcomes. </u><br>

</font>
<br>

Based on the aforementioned risk assessment, Nudge may adjust its teaching strategies, determine the frequency of course offerings, or even decide to discontinue the course altogether.
