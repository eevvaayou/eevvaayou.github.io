<span style="color: black; font-weight:bold;">Our program upholds course quality through specific standards applicable across all academic disciplines. These standards, fundamental to our evaluation process, mainly focus on teaching and learning aspects:</span>

<span style="color:#ffb300;"><u>1. Solicitation and assessment of new courses.</u>
<u>2. Evaluation of student learning outcomes.</u>
<u>3. Assessment of existing courses for potential risks.</u></span> 

<span style="color: black; font-weight:bold;">We aim to optimize course development efficiency to alleviate the extra load on our instructors, who are already deeply involved in research activities. Consequently, instructors need to understand the evaluation standards in advance.</span>

<br>

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">1.	Solicitation and assessment of new courses</span>

<span style="color: black; font-weight:bold;">At Nudge, the quality assurance process begins with collecting and evaluating course proposals. Once the contract is finalized, instructors are required to submit a course outline. Following an initial review, course development starts, emphasizing a comprehensive evaluation before the course launch. This procedure aligns course content with student needs. The main objectives are to answer key questions:</span>

- Do the courses equip students with essential knowledge for academic or professional success?

- What are the necessary adjustments for course design or teaching methods? 

- Can new techniques, resources, or materials enhance learning efficiency? 

- Are the slides and educational materials adequate, accessible, and up to educational standards? 

- Is there a system to validate predefined answers and grading methods?

<span style="color: black; font-weight:bold;">Instructors‘responses to these questions are crucial in developing effective actions and strategies to continuously improve learning experiences. Before it starts, they must provide all required course documents for each course they lead at Nudge. This includes slides, data sources, literary works, and various learning aids, aiding the Nudge team in evaluating the course’s quality and comprehensiveness.</span>

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">2. Evaluation of Learning Outcomes</span>

<span style="color: black; font-weight:bold;">These guidelines outline the key principles for assessing student learning outcomes. These principles direct our strategy to enhance student success. During the course, students are expected to achieve specific learning outcomes：</span>
  
- Demonstrate knowledge and skills in a specific discipline and apply these competencies ethically in real-life environments. 

- Utilize research skills in academic work.
  
- Locate, evaluate, and effectively use information from various sources (Information Literacy).
  
- Analyze quantitative data and derive reasonable conclusions (Quantitative Reasoning). (Quantitative Reasoning).
  
- Evaluate problems logically from multiple perspectives and develop reasonable and creative solutions (Critical Thinking).

- Communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, to diverse audiences (Communication).

<br>

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">3. Assessment of existing courses for potential risks</span>

<span style="color: black; font-weight:bold;">Nudge consistently assembles metrics for each of its academic offerings. High-risk programs exhibit one or more strategic concerns, such as course operational health, alignment with Nudge’s objectives, and market demand. Nudge employs the following indicators to identify high-risk programs:</span>

- Student enrollment and achievement metrics.

- Stakeholder satisfaction ratings, especially from students.

- Changes in instructors' expertise and resource availability.

- Course applicability and instructional effectiveness.

- Successful attainment of specified learning outcomes. 

<span style="color: black; font-weight:bold;">Following the risk assessment mentioned above, Nudge may reconsider some courses' offering frequency, or even discontinue them entirely.</span>
