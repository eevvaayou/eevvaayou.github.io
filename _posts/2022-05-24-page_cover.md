Nudge upholds course quality via distinct standards that apply across all academic disciplines. These standards, integral to our evaluation process, focus predominantly on aspects of teaching and learning:

<u>1. Solicitation and assessment of new courses.</u>

<u>2. Evaluation of student learning outcomes.</u>

<u>3. Risk-oriented appraisal of existing courses.</u>

We aim to optimize course development efficiency to alleviate any extra load on our instructors, who are already deeply involved in research activities. Consequently, it’s essential for instructors to understand the evaluation standards in advance.

##### 1.	Soliciting and Evaluating New Courses
Nudge's process of quality assurance initiates with gathering and evaluating course proposals. Upon contract finalization, instructors are tasked with submitting a course outline. After an initial evaluation, course development ensues, with a focus on completing a thorough evaluation before the course begins.

This procedure ensures a harmonization of course content with the needs of students. Its foremost goal is to address pivotal questions:

<font color="gray">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Will students attain the knowledge essential for success in academia or their profession?</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>What critical adjustments might be required for the course design or teaching methods? </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Could the addition of certain techniques, resources, or materials boost learning efficiency?  </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Do the presentation slides and educational materials meet adequacy, accessibility, and educational standards?  </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Is a system established to ensure the validity of predefined answers and grading procedures?</u><br>
</font>
<br>

The responses to these questions are instrumental for instructors in formulating relevant actions and strategies to perpetually improve learning experiences. Instructors are expected to supply all necessary course documents for each course they are set to lead at Nudge, ahead of its start. This requirement covers a range of materials such as slides, data sources, literary works, and various learning aids. These elements assist the Nudge team in assessing the courses' quality and thoroughness.

##### 2. Evaluation of Learning Outcomes
This set of guidelines provides an overview of the key principles for the assessment of student learning outcomes. These principles frame our methodology for facilitating student success in their chosen disciplines. During the course cycle, students are expected to accomplish specific learning outcomes as a result of their academic pursuits:

<font color="gray">
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Demonstrate knowledge and skills in a specific discipline, and apply these competencies ethically in real-life environments.  </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Utilize research skills in academic work.</u><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Locate, evaluate, and effectively use information from various sources (Information Literacy).</u><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Analyze quantitative data and derive reasonable conclusions (Quantitative Reasoning).</u><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Evaluate problems logically from multiple perspectives, and develop reasonable and creative solutions (Critical Thinking).</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, to diverse audiences (Communication).</u><br>

</font>
<br>
<br>

##### 3.	Risk-Adjusted Evaluation of Current Courses
Nudge consistently assembles metrics for each of its academic offerings. Programs considered high-risk exhibit one or more strategic concerns, such as course operational health, alignment with Nudge’s objectives, and market demand. Nudge employs the subsequent indicators to discern high-risk programs:

<font color="gray">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Student enrollment metrics and learning achievements.</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Satisfaction ratings from stakeholders, including students.</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Shifts in the instructors' professional expertise and resource availability.</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>The applicability of the curriculum and the efficacy of course instruction.</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Successful attainment of specified learning outcomes. </u><br>

</font>
<br>

Following the risk assessment mentioned above, Nudge may reconsider the offering frequency of some courses, or even choose to discontinue them entirely.
