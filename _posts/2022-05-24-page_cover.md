Since its inception, Nudge has been steadfast in its commitment to high-quality standards. Thus, we've implemented effective procedures to ensure our programs meet the high standards in quality, efficacy, and across all operations.
Nudge's academic quality assurance consists of several key components:

<u>1. Ensuring the high quality of new online courses and maintaining the quality of existing courses.</u>

<u>2. Upholding high standards of instruction.</u>

<u>3. Guaranteeing student achievement of learning outcomes.</u>

Therefore, Nudge has specific, clearly defined requirements for quality assurance that stand apart from our strategic planning processes, as they represent our core business. These specifically pertain to teaching and learning, including:
<br>
<br>

##### 1.	Invitation and Evaluation of New Courses
The quality of courses is first and foremost assured through a process of course invitation and new course evaluation, initiated by Nudge. Targeted instructors are approached with invitations. Upon signing, instructors are required to submit a course syllabus, followed by an initial evaluation, then the finalization of the course design. By the time the course commences, a final evaluation is ensured.

This process serves as an opportunity to align courses with student needs, primarily aiming to gather insights to answer the following:

ðŸ‘‰ <u>Will students learn content and gain knowledge essential for success in academia or their careers?</u><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Are modifications needed in our course or teaching strategies?</u><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>What additional techniques, resources, or materials could enhance learning effectiveness?</u><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Are the PowerPoint presentations and other learning resources appropriate, sufficient, and compliant?</u><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Are the established answer keys and grading schemes appropriate?</u><br>
</font>
<br>

Answering these questions helps instructors decide on the right actions and strategies, ensuring continuous improvement in the student learning experience. Instructors at Nudge must ensure all course materials for every course they lead are submitted to Nudge in advance, including but not limited to PowerPoints, database sources, literature, videos, and other learning resources. Nudge evaluates the quality and completeness of all course files.

##### 2.	Assessment of Learning Outcomes
Below are general guiding principles for evaluating learning outcomes at the program level. These define preparing students to excel in their chosen field of study. Through their academic work and extracurricular activities in the program, students will achieve the following learning outcomes:

<font color="gray">
  
ðŸ‘‰ <u>Demonstrate knowledge and skills in a particular subject and ethically apply them in real-life settings (Subject Proficiency).</u><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Employ research skills in their academic work (Research).</u><br>
  
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Locate, evaluate, and effectively utilize information from various sources (Information Literacy).</u><br>
  
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Analyze quantitative data and draw logical conclusions (Quantitative Reasoning).</u><br>
  
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Evaluate problems logically from multiple perspectives and develop reasonable and creative solutions (Critical Thinking).</u><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Communicate effectively both orally and in writing to diverse audiences (Communication).</u><br>

</font>
<br>
<br>

##### 3.	Risk-Based Evaluation of Existing Courses
Nudge regularly collects metrics for each academic program offered. High-risk programs are identified by one or more strategic risks, such as the health of the course's operations, alignment with Nudge's vision, and market demand. Nudge uses the following metrics to identify high-risk programs:

<font color="gray">

ðŸ‘‰  <u>Student numbers and outcomes (enrollment, student-to-teacher ratios, attrition rates, etc.)</u><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Stakeholder satisfaction (students, parents, etc.)</u><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Changes in instructor professional backgrounds and resources.</u><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Current and effective course delivery ("Curriculum Currency").</u><br>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Learning outcomes.</u><br>

</font>
<br>

Based on the aforementioned risk assessment, Nudge adjusts its teaching strategies, determines the frequency of offering the course, or might decide to discontinue the course altogether.
