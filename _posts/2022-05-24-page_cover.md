Nudge adheres to specific, well-defined standards that are integral to our core operations for ensuring course quality. These standards, applicable across all majors, serve as the focal points for our evaluation process. The key areas of focus pertain to teaching and learning include:

<u>1. Solicitation and appraisal of new courses.</u>

<u>2. Assessment of student learning.</u>

<u>3. Risk-based evaluation of existing courses.</u>

We strive to maintain efficiency in course development to prevent undue burden on our instructors, who are already engaged in extensive research activities. Therefore, it is essential for instructors to be well-versed with the evaluation criteria beforehand.

##### 1.	Solicitation and Appraisal of New Courses 
The quality assurance process for new courses begins with the solicitation and evaluation of new courses, initiated by Nudge. Upon contract agreement, instructors are required to submit a course outline. Following a preliminary evaluation, instructors commence course development, ensuring that the final evaluation is completed prior to the start of the course.

This process provides an opportunity for alignment between the course content and student needs. The primary objective is to gather information to address the following questions: 

<font color="gray">

ðŸ‘‰ <u>Will students acquire knowledge that we deem important or necessary for academic/professional success??</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Are modifications required in the course structure or teaching strategies? </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Are there additional techniques, resources or materials that could enhance learning effectiveness? </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Are PowerPoint presentations and other learning resources compatible, adequate and compliant? </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Is the appropriateness of established answers and grading schemes ensured?</u><br>
</font>
<br>

Responses to these questions assist instructors in determining appropriate actions and strategies for continuous improvement in learning experiences. Instructors are required to provide all course files for each course they host to Nudge in advance. This includes, but is not limited to, PowerPoint, database sources, literature, or other learning resources, which aid Nudge in evaluating the quality and completeness of all course files.

##### 2. Learning Outcome Evaluation 
The following guidelines outline the general principles for evaluating student learning outcomes. These principles define our approach towards preparing students for success in their chosen subjects. Students are expected to achieve the following learning outcomes through their academic activities during the course cycle:

<font color="gray">
  
ðŸ‘‰ <u>Demonstrate knowledge and skills in a specific discipline, and apply these competencies ethically in real-life environments.  </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Utilize research skills in academic work.</u><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Locate, evaluate, and effectively use information from various sources (Information Literacy).</u><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Analyze quantitative data and derive reasonable conclusions (Quantitative Reasoning).</u><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Evaluate problems logically from multiple perspectives, and develop reasonable and creative solutions (Critical Thinking).</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, to diverse audiences (Communication).</u><br>

<br>
<br>

##### 3.	Risk-Based Evaluation of Existing Courses 
Nudge regularly collects metrics for each academic program it offers. High-risk programs are identified as those presenting one or more strategic risks such as operational health of courses, relevance to Nudgeâ€™s vision, and market demand. Nudge uses the following indicators to identify high-risk programs: 

<font color="gray">

ðŸ‘‰  <u>Student numbers and learning outcomes (admissions, student-teacher ratio, attrition rate etc.). </u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Stakeholder satisfaction (students, parents etc.).</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Changes in instructor professional background and resources.</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Currency of curriculum and effectiveness of course delivery.</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Learning outcomes. </u><br>

</font>
<br>

Based on the aforementioned risk assessment, Nudge adjusts its teaching strategies, determines the frequency of offering the course, or might decide to discontinue the course altogether.
