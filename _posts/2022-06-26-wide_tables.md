#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">1. Standardized Course</span>

**Delivery:** interactive group online courses. 

**Enrollment:** The expected number of students for each course typically ranges from 6 to 15. Students are primarily undergraduates with academic backgrounds in disciplines related to the project or interdisciplinary fields. 

**Time Commitment:** Each tutor's course is approximately 10-12 hours long, spread over 4-6 consecutive weeks. Tutors should schedule fixed class times weekly within the course period, ensuring two consecutive sessions per week with at least 50 minutes per session. Please note that the time dedicated to course planning and evaluating student assignments is excluded from teaching hours.

**Annual Planning:** The tutors coordinate course schedules with the company based on their available time and workload. If necessary, collaborate with other tutors to conduct the courses. Generally, there are 3-4 rounds per year. 

**Class Support:** Each course has a dedicated class supervisor for the duration of the course. They ensure that the course is progressing smoothly and facilitate communication between tutors and students, resolving any course-related issues as needed.

#### <span style="color:gold; font-weight:#ffb300;">2. Course Design Framework</span>

The structured design of the course should consider aspects such as learning objectives, content, learning activities, project management for course completion, and completion standards. Below is a basic template for standard course design.

**Course Goals:** Clearly define the course learning objectives, including goals related to knowledge, skills, abilities, and practical outputs from students. These objectives should be relevant to real-world applications.

**Content:** Divide the content into different modules or stages. Each module should correspond with the learning objectives. The content should be periodically updated to continuously align with advancements in the academic field. Identify the background knowledge and prerequisites required for the course so that students can successfully complete it. When necessary, we will match students with prerequisite tutors for the course (If the instructor has suitable collaborative teaching mentors/tutors/ teaching assistants, please don't hesitate to introduce them to us.).

**Learning Activities:** Learning activities include, but are not limited to, case studies, online discussions, coding tests, or competitions. These activities should inspire students' learning and research and cultivate problem-solving skills and critical thinking.

**Final Project Assignment Management:** Determine the time schedule, resource requirements, and team composition (if necessary) for the students' final projects. Clearly outline the management plan for their completion, including progress tracking, problem support, and collaborative task assignments (if necessary).

**Assessment Criteria:** Specify the standard criteria for the final assessments to ensure fairness and consistency in evaluation. Students must meet the expected requirements to complete the course.

#### <span style="color:gold; font-weight:#ffb300;">3. Homework Management</span>

**Clear Expectations and Workload:** Tutors should clearly outline the students' weekly homework tasks. Between one and three homework tasks are recommended. Tutors should estimate the time required for each assignment to ensure the total workload does not exceed 10 hours per week. To avoid conflicts with students' School learning tasks, if a tutor's weekly homework time is expected to exceed 10 hours,  consider further task delineation or adjustment of homework requirements.

**Assignment Planning:** Students should be informed in advance of their weekly homework tasks and deadlines to allow for proper time management.

**Streamlining Management Tools:** Tutors should select homework management software from the list provided by the company that aligns with their course. They must inform company at least one week before the course begins so that we can prepare the course page and invite tutors to join. (We invite the tutors to tell us if they have more suitable homework software.)

If no homework software is needed, tutors can choose to have students submit homework and provide feedback to students via email. This method requires tutors and students to cc the class supervisor on all communications.

**Pre-Class Assessment and Feedback:** The tutors should review all student work at least one day before class. Feedback and evaluation of student homework during class should not exceed 15 minutes, not excessively occupying normal class time.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">4. The Final Project</span>

**Determining Final Project Topics:** By the third week of the course or earlier, the tutors need to assist each student in determining their final project topic/research topic to ensure that students have enough time to prepare and complete it before the end of the course. The estimated completion time for the final project assignment should be between 20 and 30 hours. The tutors should regularly monitor the progress students are making with their projects and provide feedback and support.

**Final Project Formats:** The tutors can design final project assignments as research proposals, modeling and design projects, software development, or other practical projects. The tutors should provide further guidance to students who may produce conference papers after the course ends. We will limit the guidance time to approximately four hours four weeks after the course ends.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">5. Course Conclusion</span>

**Final Project Presentation:** The students are required to present their final projects in the last week of the course. For courses with a large number of registrants, the tutors may limit the number of presenters, such as selecting students who volunteer to present individually or in groups. Students who do not present their final projects will submit their results online to the company and the tutors for final evaluation.

**Certificate:** Tutors, or Nudge with the tutor's authorization, will assess each student based on the evaluation criteria and issue course certificates to each student authorized by the tutor.

**Recommendation Letters:** The tutors should write recommendation letters for outstanding students with specific needs. When writing recommendation letters or evaluations, the tutors should provide specific descriptions of student achievements and abilities. However, the writing of recommendation letters is not mandatory.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">6. Course Materials</span>

**Material Submission:** Tutors are required to submit all course materials one week before the start of the teaching session to allow the company sufficient time to review and prepare.

**Resource Variety:** Necessary course materials include slides for all sessions, relevant assignment materials, programming software tools (if necessary), etc. Other course materials may include audiovisual materials, resource links, code, datasets, and any other supportive materials. If necessary, tutors should assist company personnel in checking whether the materials can be accessed and used smoothly by students before the teaching session to ensure smooth access and utilization of course materials.

**Review and Updates:** Tutors should regularly review course materials to ensure accuracy and completeness and make updates and adjustments as necessary.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">7. Hourly Rate</span>

The tutors' hourly rates generally remain stable, but to ensure fairness and transparency, rates may vary based on market demand, tutors' roles, and the overall value of the courses provided.
We will provide tutors with an explanation of how hourly rates are calculated and factors affecting changes in advance and reach a consensus before the course begins.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">8. Video Quality and Access</span>

Ensure high-definition video quality. 
The audio must be clear and not disruptive for students. 
Utilize a landscape format for display. 
Access the course via computer.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">9. Testing Services</span>

We recommend contacting us as soon as possible for testing services to obtain personalized support and feedback on your audio and video quality.

#### <span style="color:#ffb300; font-weight:bold;">10. Policy Compliance</span>

Please adhere to our legal terms and Instructor Conduct Guidelines.
